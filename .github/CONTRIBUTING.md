# Contributing to ExportMlx

Contributions are appreciated! Right now I mostly need [feature requests, bug reports](https://github.com/janklab/ExportMlx/issues), and especially example Live Script files that ExportMlx can be tested against.

All contributions to ExportMlx, including example Live Script files, must be dual-licensed under the BSD 3-Clause License and the special MathWorks-specific variant of the BSD 2-Clause License that ExportMlx is currently licensed under. This is so that ExportMlx can be easily relicensed to BSD 3-Clause in the future if its underlying `livescript2markdown` code is similarly relicensed. (Which would be nice, IMHO.)

## Code Style

### Code Formatting

* 4 space indents.
* Spaces after commas that separate function arguments or list items.
* Spaces around operators.
* Use Matlab auto-formatting (Ctrl-A, Ctrl-I) everywhere.
