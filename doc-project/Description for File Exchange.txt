Janklab's MlxShake is a tool to export Matlab Live Scripts (`.mlx` files) to Markdown and other formats. It can export to Markdown, HTML, PDF, Microsoft Word, and more.

This tool lets you generate project documentation and web site content from live scripts in your project. This is a nice way of generating rich documentation with included graphics that are up to date with your latest code.

See the Tutorial at https://mlxshake.janklab.net/Tutorial.html for examples of what it can do. The Tutorial is itself generated from a Matlab live script using MlxShake!


Super quick examples:

janklab.mlxshake.exportlivescript('MyLiveScript.mlx')

From the shell or other programs:

./bin/mlxshake MyLiveScript.mlx --format html

The full documentation is available on the MlxShake web site at https://mlxshake.janklab.net.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

MlxShake is based on, and started out as a fork of, MathWorker Michio Inoue's livescript2markdown tool (https://github.com/minoue-xx/livescript2markdown). MlxShake can largely be viewed as a productization of livescript2markdown.

The Live Script to LaTeX export code is informed by Pavel Roslovets's Live-Script-to-Markdown-Converter toolbox (https://github.com/roslovets/Live-Script-to-Markdown-Converter).

MlxShake adds the following enhancements:

* Automate the full process from `.mlx` to `.md`.
* Be suitable for use in automated document generation processes.
* Make the Markdown good enough that no manual touch-up is usually needed.
* Produce nicely-formatted output files.
* Support additional output formats.

LICENSE WARNING

MlxShake is licensed under a nonstandard MathWorks-specific variant of the BSD 2-Clause License that includes this additional clause:

* In all cases, the software is, and all modifications and derivatives of the
  software shall be, licensed to you solely for use in conjunction with
  MathWorks products and service offerings.

This is because the livescript2markdown project is licensed that way, and MlxShake contains derivatives of its code.
