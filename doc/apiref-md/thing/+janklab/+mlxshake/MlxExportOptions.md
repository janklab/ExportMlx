# janklab.mlxshake.MlxExportOptions

```text
Options to control behavior of Live Script export

All the options to control the behavior of exportlivescript and
its helper functions are bundled up in this class.

The constructor accepts name/value pairs as a 2n-long cell vector or
struct, so anywhere you can provide an ExportOptions object, you can also
pass in a cell or struct of property definitions, which will automatically
be converted to an ExportOptions.
